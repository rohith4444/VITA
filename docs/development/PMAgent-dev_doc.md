### Implemented Workflow Nodes
1. receive_input
   - Handles initial project requirements
   - Stores in short-term memory

2. analyze_requirements
   - Uses LLM for requirement analysis
   - Structures project requirements
   - Stores in working memory

3. generate_project_plan
   - Creates milestones and tasks
   - Allocates resources
   - Estimates timeline

### Tech Stack
- LangChain: Graph-based agent workflow
- LangGraph: State management
- OpenAI GPT-4: LLM for analysis
- Memory System:
  - Short-term: Conversation context
  - Working: Active project state
  - Long-term: Project history

### Tools Implementation
1. Task Breakdown
   - LLM-based task generation
   - Effort estimation
   - Dependency tracking

2. Resource Allocation
   - Agent skill matching
   - Task assignment
   - Simple workload distribution

3. Timeline Generation
   - Basic effort calculation
   - Developer-based estimation
   - Simple timeline projection

### Memory Usage
- Short-term: Stores current conversation
- Working: Active project details
- Long-term: Completed projects and plans

### Error Handling
- Input validation
- LLM response parsing
- Memory operation handling
