# Detailed Implementation Plan for Phase 1: Scrum Master Agent Foundation

Below is a step-by-step implementation plan for Phase 1, showing the order of file creation/modification to handle dependencies properly.

## Implementation Order with Dependencies

### Step 1: Basic Structure and Interface Definitions
1. **Create basic agent structure and state definitions**
   - `agents/scrum_master/__init__.py`
   - `agents/scrum_master/sm_state_graph.py` (Define states without implementation)
   - `agents/scrum_master/llm/sm_prompts.py` (Basic prompt templates)

### Step 2: Core Communication Tools
2. **Implement communication mechanisms**
   - `tools/scrum_master/__init__.py` 
   - `tools/scrum_master/checkpoint_manager.py` (Track approvals/checkpoints)
   - Modify `tools/team_lead/agent_communicator.py` to recognize Scrum Master agent

### Step 3: Human-AI Interface Tools
3. **Create user interaction components**
   - `tools/scrum_master/feedback_processor.py` (Process and categorize user feedback)
   - `tools/scrum_master/milestone_presenter.py` (Format milestones for user consumption)

### Step 4: LLM Service Implementation
4. **Implement specialized LLM service**
   - `agents/scrum_master/llm/__init__.py`
   - `agents/scrum_master/llm/sm_service.py` (Focused on user communication)

### Step 5: Complete State Graph
5. **Finish state graph with all transitions**
   - Complete `agents/scrum_master/sm_state_graph.py` with all states and transitions
   - Add validation, decision-making, and routing logic

### Step 6: Agent Implementation
6. **Complete Scrum Master agent implementation**
   - `agents/scrum_master/sm_agent.py` (Full implementation using all components)

### Step 7: Visualization Tools
7. **Add visualization capabilities**
   - `tools/scrum_master/progress_visualizer.py` (Create visualizations for user)

### Step 8: Integration with Team Lead
8. **Update Team Lead to work with Scrum Master**
   - Modify `agents/team_lead/tl_state_graph.py` to add states for Scrum Master interaction
   - Modify `agents/team_lead/tl_agent.py` to implement these new states
